Menu choices are framed within a box element and arranged in a grid. **Box Menu** allows you to direct the learner to either further menus (sub menus) or to one or more pages of content. The **Box Menu** default is show a title, an image, some body text, duration, a progress indicator and a link button.

[Visit the **Box Menu** wiki](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-boxmenu/wiki) for more information about its functionality and for explanations of key properties. Options include an estimated time for completion (duration) and a progress bar to indicate the percentage of components that have been completed.

##Installation

As Adapt's *[core menu](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-Plug-ins-in-the-Adapt-Learning-Framework#menu),* **Box Menu** is included with the [installation of the Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Manual-installation-of-the-Adapt-framework#installation) and the [installation of the Adapt authoring tool](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-Adapt-Origin).

* If **Box Menu** has been uninstalled from the Adapt framework, it may be reinstalled.
With the [Adapt CLI](https://github.com/cajones/adapt-cli) installed, run the following from the command line:  
`adapt install adapt-contrib-boxMenu`

    Alternatively, this component can also be installed by adding the following line of code to the *adapt.json* file:  
    `"adapt-contrib-boxMenu": "*"`  
    Then running the command:  
    `adapt install`  
    (This second method will reinstall all plug-ins listed in *adapt.json*.)  

* If **Box Menu** has been uninstalled from the Adapt authoring tool, it may be reinstalled using the [Plug-in Manager](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Plugin-Manager).

##Uninstallation  
The Adapt framework does not allow the installation of more than one menu at a time. In order to replace **Box Menu** it must be uninstalled. With the root of your framework installation as your current working directory, run the following command:  
`adapt uninstall adapt-contrib-boxMenu`
