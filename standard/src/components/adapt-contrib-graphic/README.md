**Graphic** displays graphic content that has been optimized for various devices. The component swaps out images based upon the device's screen size. These device widths are specified in *less/generic.less* of the [Vanilla theme](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-vanilla).

[Visit the **Graphic** wiki](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-graphic/wiki) for more information about its functionality and for explanations of key properties. 

##Installation

As one of Adapt's *[core components](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-Plug-ins-in-the-Adapt-Learning-Framework#components),* **Graphic** is included with the [installation of the Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Manual-installation-of-the-Adapt-framework#installation) and the [installation of the Adapt authoring tool](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-Adapt-Origin).

* If **Graphic** has been uninstalled from the Adapt framework, it may be reinstalled.
With the [Adapt CLI](https://github.com/cajones/adapt-cli) installed, run the following from the command line:  
`adapt install adapt-contrib-graphic`

    Alternatively, this component can also be installed by adding the following line of code to the *adapt.json* file:  
    `"adapt-contrib-graphic": "*"`  
    Then running the command:  
    `adapt install`  
    (This second method will reinstall all plug-ins listed in *adapt.json*.)  

* If **Graphic** has been uninstalled from the Adapt authoring tool, it may be reinstalled using the [Plug-in Manager](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Plugin-Manager).

### Attributes

[**core model attributes**](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes): These are inherited by every Adapt component. [Read more](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes).

**_component** (string): This value must be: `graphic`.

**_classes** (string): CSS class name to be applied to **Graphic**’s containing `div`. The class must be predefined in one of the Less files. Separate multiple classes with a space.

**_layout** (string): This defines the horizontal position of the component in the block. Acceptable values are `full`, `left` or `right`.  

**instruction** (string): This optional text appears above the component. It is frequently used to
guide the learner’s interaction with the component.  

**_graphic** (object): The image that constitutes the component. It contains values for **alt**, **large**, and **small**.

>**alt** (string): This text becomes the image’s `alt` attribute. 

>**large** (string): File name (including path) of the image used with large device width. Path should be relative to the *src* folder (e.g., *course/en/images/origami-menu-two.jpg*).  

>**small** (string): File name (including path) of the image used with small device width. Path should be relative to the *src* folder (e.g., *course/en/images/origami-menu-two.jpg*).  

>**attribution** (string): Optional text to be displayed as an [attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Best_practices_for_attribution). By default it is displayed below the image. Adjust positioning by modifying CSS. Text can contain HTML tags, e.g., `Copyright © 2015 by <b>Lukasz 'Severiaan' Grela</b>`
